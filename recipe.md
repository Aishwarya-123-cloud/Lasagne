Start by spreading a layer of your tomato-based sauce (either a plain tomato sauce or your pre-made ragù) on the bottom of your dish. Next, add a single layer of pasta sheets. 
Then, add a layer of white sauce, vegetables followed by another single layer of pasta sheets. 
Carry on alternating the tomato sauce, lasagne sheets, vegetables and white sauce until you get to the top of the dish, or your sauces run out!
Finish off your lasagne either with a layer of tomato-based sauce or with your white sauce – whichever you have left.
Lasltly, grate over plenty of Cheese. A common extra topping is torn mozzarella, which makes a lovely, melted cheesy layer on top.
